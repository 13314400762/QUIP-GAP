While in principle things are quite flexible, the default setup assumes
that things are set up as follows
  top_dir/
    libAtoms/
    QUIP/
    QUIP_Utils/
    QUIP_Programs/
    Makefiles/

To compile, you need to create and appropriate Makefiles/Makefile.my_arch_name

You will need LAPACK, which will need to be put in via ARCH_LIBDIRS and ARCH_LAPACK_LIBDIRS
in Makefile.my_arch_name

You will also need FoX (for QUIP), which will need ARCH_FOX_INCLUDEDIR and ARCH_FOX_LIBDIR
to be set properly in Makefile.my_arch_name

finally, in QUIP_Programs, just do:
  ./build.sh my_arch_name target

Targets:
  eval - evaluates energy/forces/virial of a configuration
