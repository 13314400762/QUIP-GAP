QUIP depends on libAtoms and FoX
libAtoms can be obtained from www.libatoms.org

FoX can be obtained from http://www.uszla.me.uk/FoX/
  As of 1/6/2007, the latest version (2.1.1) of FoX has some
    bugs that adversely affect QUIP.  The patch against FoX
    to fix the bugs is in FoX.2.1.1.patch.  Please apply it
    before compiling FoX by doing
      cd FoX-2.1.1
      patch -p1 < ../QUIP/FoX.2.1.1.patch
