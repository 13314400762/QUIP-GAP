pyatomsf
--------

This package is a Python interface to libAtoms (and optionally, also
to QUIP). To use it you must have Python >= 2.4 installed as well as
the numpy extension (http://www.scipy.org/numpy). ipython
(http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/) makes using python interactively
much more productive.

Installation
------------

Before installing, there's a patch file which needs to be applied to
numpy. This gets optional arguments to work correctly between python
and fortran, and I've only tested it with gfortran. It was created
against numpy-1.2.1. To apply the patch, you need to find where
numpy is installed:

$ python
>>> import numpy
>>> print numpy.__file__

Then go to this directory, and change to the f2py subdirectory.
Apply the patch as:

$ patch -p0 < ~/Code/pyatomf/numpy.f2py.rule.patch

To compile pyatomsf, edit the Makefile to set the LIBATOMS_DIR and
QUIP_DIR variables, then do a 'make -I ../Makefiles' followed by 'make
-I ../Makefiles install'. This should build everything and install the
Python modules in ~/lib/python. If you're not using gfortran you'll
also have to edit the COMPILER_OPTS variable. Run the command 'python
setup.py config_fc --help-fcompiler' for a list of detected fortran
compilers.

To check everything is working try the following:

$ python
>>> import pyatomsf

To enable the QUIP bindings set HAVE_QUIP=1 in the Makefile and
rebuild and install. If you are using gfortran, the QUIP bindings
require a recent svn version of gfortran to compile (with 4.3.2 or
earlier you run into this bug, reported by Steve and now fixed:
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=37735)


Usage
-----

The pyatomsf tries to expose all the libAtoms functions
in an object-oriented way. Here is some sample code that loads
an Atoms object from a NetCDF file:

>>> from pyatomsf import *
>>> a = Atoms()
>>> a.read_xyz_filename('clusters.xyz')

or

>>> nc = NetCDFFile('crack.nc')
>>> nc.read_atoms(a)

Since Python is case-sensitive, and Fortran is not, all variable
and functions names are converted to lower case. The only exception
is type names which are wrapped by classes with the same capitalisation
as the type definition in Fortran (e.g. Atoms, NetCDFFile above).

If you're using ipython, the full documentation strings for each class
and function can be seen by typing the name of the thing you're
interested in, followed by a ?. For example "Atoms ?", "a.n ?" or
"Atoms.lattice ?" (if you're using standard python, you can get the
same information by typing help(object), e.g.  help(Atoms)).
