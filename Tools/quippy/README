The aim of quippy is to make all the functions, subroutines and types
defined in QUIP available from Python scripts. 

Quick-start:
 $ make
 $ make install
 $ cd tests
 $ python run_all.py

For more details, see documentation in doc/ subdirectory, which is in
reStructredText format.

If you have sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org) installed, 'make html'
from 'doc/' will build HTML documentation.
