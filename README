This is the top level directory for QUIP, libAtoms and friends. 

1) decide your architecture by looking at the Makefiles/README, and
define an environmental variable QUIP_ARCH, e.g. 

   export QUIP_ARCH=darwin_x86_64_gfortran

2) make something:

   make libAtoms
 
   or 

   make QUIP_Programs/<progname>

   Note how the `make' command has to be executed from the top level
   directory, even for targets of subdirectories. 

   Most useful progname include
    eval : evaluate energies, forces, minimize energy etc
    md : basic md program

The Makefile will create a build directory, build.${QUIP_ARCH}, and all
the building happen there. First it will ask you some questions about
where you keep libraries and other stuff, if you don't use something it
is asking for, just leave it blank. The answers will be stored in
Makefile.inc in the build directory, and you can edit them later (e.g. to
change optimisation or debug options).
