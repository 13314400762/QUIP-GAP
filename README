This is the top level directory for QUIP, libAtoms and friends. 

1) decide your architecture by looking at the Makefiles/README, and
define an environmental variable QUIP_ARCH, e.g. 

   export QUIP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_ifort_icc

You may well need to create your own Makefiles/Makefile.${QUIP_ARCH}
file based on an existing file.

2) make something:

   make libAtoms
 
   or (usually)

   make QUIP_Programs/<progname>

   Note that the `make' command has to be executed from the top level
   directory, even for targets in subdirectories. 

   Most useful make targets include
    all : pretty much every vaguely useful program
    QUIP_Programs/eval : evaluate energies, forces, minimize energy etc
    QUIP_Programs/md : basic md program
    install : copies all compiled programs it can find to QUIP_INSTDIR,
      if it's defined and is a directory

   The Makefile will create a build directory, build.${QUIP_ARCH}, and
   all the building happen there. First it will ask you some questions
   about where you keep libraries and other stuff, if you don't use
   something it is asking for, just leave it blank. The answers will
   be stored in Makefile.inc in the build.${QUIP_ARCH} directory, and
   you can edit them later (e.g. to change optimisation or debug
   options).  Note that the default state is usually with rather heavy
   debugging on, including bounds checking, which makes the code quite
   slow.

   You can also use QUIP and libAtoms as a library and link to it. To make the
   library version only, execute

   make libquip

   This will make all the various libraries and combine them into one: 
   build.${QUIP_ARCH}/libquip.a, which is what you need to link (and of course
   LAPACK).
