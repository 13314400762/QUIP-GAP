\section{Introduction}

Many chemical processes of scientific and technological importance
involve the breaking and formation of covalent bonds between atoms,
in the presence of large structures and large numbers of solvent
molecules.  Describing the bond breaking process requires a reliable
quantum-mechanical description of interatomic bonding.  However,
such methods are limited to a few hundred atoms at most, but often
the reaction region is affected, directly or indirectly, by many
more atoms or molecules.  The large number of atoms required can
be described with classical interatomic potentials, but these can
not describe the bond breaking itself.  To include both of these
effects, methods that couple the different computational approaches
have been developed.  These methods are referred to as hybrid or
concurrent coupling schemes in the solid state
literature~\cite{curtin_model_simul_mater_sci_eng_2003a,csanyi_j_phys_condens_mater_2005a,bernstein_rep_prog_phys_2009a} and
as QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) in the chemistry
literature~\cite{senn_topics_cur_chem_2007a,lin_theor_chem_acc_2005a}.

A number of challenges can arise in the development of a hyrid
simulation method: boundary effects at the edge of each simulation
(QM or MM) region, coupling the two regions mechanically and
electostatically, and moving the QM region (or moving atoms into
or out of a fixed region).  Various subsets of these problems have
been handled in different ways in published implementations, as we
discuss in more detail in the next section.  It is important to
determine what consitutes ``success'' for a hybrid method.  We
focus on reproducing observables (i.e. ensemble averages) in the
QM region is agreement with a full QM simulation.  Agreement with
experiment is also important, of course, but a hybrid method that 
agrees with experiment when the underlying, nominally accurate,
QM method does not is simply benefitting from a cancellation of
errors, and is unlikely to be transferable or reliable.

In this project we have implemented a hybrid method based on atomic
forces that attempts to address all of these issues.  We have tested
it on a relatively challenging system, liquid water and ions solvated
in water, and shown that the hybrid method is good at reproducing
the fully QM simulation.

\section{Background}

The QM/MM approach in chemistry was first introduced by
Warshel~\cite{warshel_j_mol_biol_1976a} for the study of a reaction
in the active site of an enzymatic protein.  It has since been
applied to many systems, some recently reviewed in
Refs.\onlinecite{senn_topics_cur_chem_2007a} and
\onlinecite{lin_theor_chem_acc_2005a}.  The vast majority of QM/MM
implementation in the chemistry community begin by defining a total
energy for the coupled system.  In addition, a fixed set of atoms
or molecules is assumed to form the QM region.  While these assumptions
make it possible to construct a simulation that conserves total
energy, they lead to some limitations.  The first is that great
care is needed to terminate the QM and MM calculations that are to
be coupled together into an (ideally) seamless single system.  An
example of the sophistication needed for such coupling is described
in Ref.~\onlinecite{laio_j_chem_phys_2002a} for a molecular system, and in
Ref.~\onlinecite{sokol_int_j_quant_chem_2004a,sherwood_j_mol_struct_theochem_2003a} for an ionic solid-state
system.  The second is that it is impossible to change the contents
of the QM region, because doing so will necessarily change the total
energy.  In fact the observables that researchers are typically
interested in are actually constant temperature, not constant energy,
ensemble averages, since that is how experiments are usually carried
out.

\subsection{Variable QM region}

Some attempts to go beyond these limitations and to simulate liquids,
where diffusion is significant, have been published.  The first of
these is the ONIOM-XS method by Kerdcharoen and
Morokuma~\cite{kerdcharoen_chem_phys_lett_2002a}.  This approach is
based on the ONIOM method, which is one of the simplest approaches
for coupling different computational methods.  In ONIOM~\cite{svensson_j_phys_chem_1996a},
the total energy
$$ E = E_1(1+2) + E_2(1) - E_1(1), $$
where $E_1$ is the energy evaluated with the fast method (MM), $E_2$ is
the method evaluated with the slow method (QM), and the arguments
indicate the two regions where the two methods are to be used.  In
ONIOM-XS, a transition region between the two regions is defined.
When there are atoms in the transition region, the total energy is
a linear combination of two ONIOM total energies, one with the
transition region atoms included in region 1, the other with the
atoms included in region 2.  As Truhlar noted, this approach is not
consistent when there is more than 1 molecule in the transition
region~\cite{heyden_j_phys_chem_b_2007a}.  ONIOM-XS has been used
in a few applications to the solvation of
ions~\cite{kerdcharoen_j_chem_phys_2003a,hofer_j_amer_chem_soc_2005a}.

Heyden {\it et al.} developed the Adaptive Partitioning method,
which essentially solves the consistency issues of ONIOM-XS at the
expense of increased computational cost~\cite{heyden_j_phys_chem_b_2007a}.
In this method, instead of a linear combination of two calculations,
many simply-partitioned calculations are combined.  The most expensive
variant uses a linear combination of every permutation of possible
assignment of molecules in the transition region to the QM and MM
regions.  A simplified ``sorted'' variant orders the molecules in
increasing distance from the QM region, and combines calculations
that include in the QM region the nearest molecule, two nearest
molecules, three nearest molecules, and so on.  The paper tests the
methods on two small systems, the solvation in water of a Li$^+$
ion, and liquid Ar.  The MM water molecules were described with the
CF2-BJH potential, and the QM region with density functional theory
(DFT) with the PBE0 density functional.  The Ar liquid was used to
test constant energy and constant temperature calculations, using
two different interatomic potentials (Lennard-Jones and Morse),
rather than a QM and an MM description.  In comparison to ONIOM-XS
and Rode's hot-spot method, described below, the method shows
smoother forces as molecules move between the two regions, but there
is no comparison to full QM simulations.

Hodak {\it et al.} developed a coupling scheme for two different
QM methods, Kohn-Sham DFT (KS-DFT) with a plane-wave basis~\cite{kohn_phys_rev_1965a}
and orbital-free DFT (OF-DFT) using fixed Gaussian charge
distributions~\cite{hodak_j_chem_phys_2008a}.  The mismatch between
these two methods is much smaller than between typical QM and MM
methods, so the edge effect and discontinuity problems are inherently
smaller.  The molecules change identity abruptly as the move between
the KS-DFT and OF-DFT regions.  The method is applied to liquid
water and to a protein-metal binding interaction.  The authors use
constraints to fix the geoemtry of the water molecules in the OF-DFT
region, and take care to apply a thermostat to molecules that have
changed identity to compensate for the addition or removal of
distortion potential energy and vibrational kinetic energy.  Tests
of the method for water are restricted to the dipole of a KS-DFT
water, and internal consistency (e.g. energy conservation).

The main exception to the energy based coupling commonly used in
the chemistry community is the hot-spot method, first presented by
Kerdcharoen {\it et al.}~\cite{kerdcharoen_chem_phys_1996a}.  In
this approach, the system is divided into a QM region and an MM
region, with a thin transition region between them, typically a
0.2~{\AA} spherical shell around a spherical QM region.  Each
calculation is carried out separately, with transition region atoms
in both calculations, and the {\em forces} on each atom are combined
to give a complete set of forces for the simulation.   For atoms
in the QM and MM regions, the forces from that calculation are used.
For atoms in the transition region, a linear combination of the two
forces $f^{QM}$ and $f^{MM}$ is used
$$f_i = x_i f_i^{QM} + (1-x_i) f_i^{MM},$$
with the cofficients $x_i$ changing smoothly from 1 to 0
as the positions vary from inner to outer boundaries of the transition
region.  Note that because these forces are not the gradients of a
scalar function (the potential energy), they do not lead to
trajectories that obey conservation of momentum or energy.  In
nearly 50 subsequent publications by Rode {\it et al.} citing
Ref.~\onlinecite{kerdcharoen_chem_phys_1996a}, this method has been
used for studying pure water, as well as a large number ions solvated
in water and other solvents such as ammonia.  Most of these focused
on metal ions and complexes, although a few considered the hydration
of other ions such as F$^-$ and
Cl$^-$~\cite{tongraar_phys_chem_chem_phys_2003a},
NO$^{3-}$~\cite{tongraar_j_phys_chem_a_2006a}, and pure
water~\cite{xenides_j_chem_phys_2005a,xenides_j_mol_liq_2006a}.

\subsection{Fixed QM region}

In addition to the work in the previous subsection, a few publications
have presented results from QM/MM calculations on liquids with a
fixed set of atoms in the QM region.  To do this, the QM region
was restricted to a single molecule, or a molecule and a reacting
ion;  the rest of the molecules were then effectively treated
as a solvent, which doesn't truly participate in the reaction,
and can be described with an interatomic potential.

Walewski {\it et al.} used a semi-empirical QM method, the
charge-self-consistent density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB),
and the SPC model for water~\cite{walewski_chem_phys_lett_2004a}.
The coupling was energy based, with an additive expression for the
interaction between the QM and MM regions.  The method was applied
to pure water, and to the geometry and proton transfer in malonaldehyde,
a 9-atom ring molecule.  For water a single molecule was treated
with QM, and the rest with MM.  For malonaldehyde, the malonaldehyde
molecule itself was described with QM, and the solvent water molecules
with MM.  There is no comparison with full DFT for pure water,
although the authors do note that the diffusion cofficients of the
two underlying models (SCC-DFTB and SPC) do not agree with each
other or with experiment.  There is no discussion of whether this
mismatch leads to artifacts, as were seen in
Ref.~\onlinecite{winfield_thesis_2009a}.

Geerke {\it et al.} used an additive, energy based coupling to
simulate H-bonding in water, and a exchange of a chloride ion from
amino chloride in a dimethyl ether (DME) solvent.  The QM region
consists of a pair of water molecules and the reacting molecule,
respectively.  They compared various semi-empirical QM methods, and
a polarizable and non-polarizable interatomic potentials for DME,
but there was no comparison to a full QM calculation.  The authors
did find that for water, in comparison to experiment, the QM-MM
interaction terms could be fine tuned to improve the total energy
of the pure liquid more accurate, but this would make the agreement
for the water-dimer dissociation energy worse.  This is an example
of the dangers of fine tuning of these interaction parameters, and
the likelihood of reducing transferability upon such adjustment.
For the Cl$^-$ exchange reaction free energy barriers and differences
were computed from the potential of mean force (mean force on the
reacting species constrained to one point in the reaction path).

\section{Technical Approach}

We have developed a coupling method based on forces that is designed
to give accurate QM forces in the QM region.  We do this by applying
the QM calculation not only to the atoms where we need QM forces, but
also to a buffer layer of surrounding atoms.  These atoms are present to
insulate our QM region from edge effects, but their QM forces are ignored.
We still take advantage of the methods developed to passivate the broken
covalent bonds and electrostatic coupling when possible, but we can
systematically improve the accuracy of the forces in the QM region by
increasing the thickness of the buffer layer.  The non-buffer QM region
forces are combined with MM forces for the MM and buffer regions, as shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:buffered_hybrid_diagram}, and used to compute trajectories.

\begin{figure}

to generate a complete set of forces for trajectory calculations.}
\label{fig:buffered_hybrid_diagram}
\end{figure}

The advantages of the buffered force mixing method over previously
applied methods are significant.  The forces in the QM region are
more accurate, especially in the presence of polarization as can
occur in polar regions of a protein~\cite{solt_j_phys_chem_b_2009a}.  The software has
robust adaptive algorithms for QM and buffer atom selection, tested
in previous applications, enabling the transfer of solvent molecules
in and out of the QM region.  Finally, the method has already been
shown to work well for solid state systems, where other methods
used for biochemical application QM/MM are inaccurate~\cite{bernstein_rep_prog_phys_2009a},
and will therefore be useful for situations where a solid
substrate, e.g. a solid state support for a catalytic molecule,
is present.

The underlying QM method we use is density functional theory (DFT)
with the BLYP generalized gradient approximation (GGA)~\cite{kohn_phys_rev_1965a,becke_phys_rev_a_1988a,lee_phys_rev_b_1988a}.  For
the MM region we use the CHARMM force field, which includes 2, 3,
and 4 body terms (bond stretching, bending, and dihedral angle),
as well as non-bonded van der Waals type terms and fixed atomic
point charges~\cite{brooks_j_comp_chem_2009a}.  Both of these are implemented in the CP2K
software~\cite{vandevondele_comp_phys_comm_2005a,laino_j_chem_theor_comp_2006a}.  In addition, a conventional QM/MM coupling
method is also implemneted in CP2K.  When computing the MM forces,
the whole system is passed to a CP2K MM calculation.  When computing
the QM forces, a QM/MM system is passed to CP2K, treating the QM
region and buffer region atoms as QM within CP2K.  The resulting
forces outside the QM region are ignored.


The whole simulation proceeds as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
read initial configuration
repeat:
  calculate connectivity for MM force-field terms
  calculate MM forces using CP2K
  calculate QM/MM forces using CP2K
  combine MM forces in MM and buffer regions and QM/MM forces in QM region
  use combined forces to propagate configuration in time
\end{verbatim}
This method has been implemented in the {\tt libAtoms} and {\tt QUIP}
libraries, developed jointly by the PIs.  The software provides a framework
that automates the connectivity and MM force-field term calculations,
invokes CP2K on a variety of parallel computers, and carries out the time
integration using the velocity Verlet algorithm~\cite{frenkel_2002a}.  In addition,
various constraints can be applied and computable quantities tabulated.
These include structural properties, such as pair correlation functions
and neighbor numbers, temperatures, energies, and ensemble-averaged
forces that contribute the free energy difference calculations using
thermodynamic integration~\cite{frenkel_2002b}.

Past experience has shown that it is not trivial to properly thermostat
all the atomic degrees of freedom~\cite{winfield_thesis_2009a}.
This frequently overlooked issue can be manifested in various ways, including
temperature oscillations, or trajectories for light degrees of freedom
(i.e. H atoms) that do not equilibrate with the other, heavier atoms.
We have found that a combination of Nose-Hoover and Langevin thermostats
with different parameters in the QM, boundary, and MM regions works well
to keep the system in a well-equilibrated, constant temperature ensemble.
