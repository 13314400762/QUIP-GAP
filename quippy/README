The aim of quippy is to make all the functions, subroutines and types
defined in QUIP available from Python scripts. 

Quick-start:
 $ export QUIP_ARCH=linux_x86_64_gfortran
 $ cd ${QUIP_ROOT}
 $ make quippy
 $ make install-quippy

For more details, see documentation in doc/ subdirectory, which is in
reStructredText format.

If you have sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org) installed, 'make html'
from 'doc/' will build HTML documentation, 

The documentation is also available online at
